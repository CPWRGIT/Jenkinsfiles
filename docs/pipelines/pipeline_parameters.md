# <a id="The pipeline parameters"></a> The pipeline parameters

The two primary pipelines - and some of the other code examples - use a set of parameters that are taken from several sources - both names and values. 
This table documents, the different names the parameters appear under, how and where to define them, where the parameters are read from, how to determine which value to specify as used in the `PipelineConfig` class and the [Mainframe_CI_Pipeline_from_Shared_Lib](../pipelines/Mainframe_CI_Pipeline_from_Shared_Lib.html).
