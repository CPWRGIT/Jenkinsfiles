# <a id="The Jenkins Groovy dialect"></a> Things to consider when using Jenkins Groovy
Having learned Groovy and pipeline scripting at the same time from ground up - without having any decent background in any of the undelying "*modern*" principles or languages - has been an interesting experience. It was (and still is) a constant struggle to figure out, if I am doing something I shouldn't do at all or simply something that I cannot do inside Jenkins. Definitely something that did not help speeding up the learning experience. This section is deicated to listing and pointing out those pitfalls and learning experiences that we went through, to help people saving the same struggle and speed up their getting productive. And the same time it is supposed as a "reference" to explain why some things were done they way they are done in the showcased examples.
Any hints and suggestions to improve or circumnavigate the pitfalls in smarter ways are highly apprectiated.
