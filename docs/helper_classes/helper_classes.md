# <a id="Helper classes"></a> Helper classes
The helper classes primarily serve as wrapper classes for the use of the different methods used by the plugins. Other serve purposes like provided configuration data (`PipelineConfig`) or preparing `JCL` for one specific execution of a pipeline (`JclSkeleton`).

## <a id="FileHelper"></a> FileHelper
The [`FileHelper`](./FileHelper.html) class is used to read external files and provides the methods

[`FileHelper(steps)`](./FileHelper.html#FileHelper)

> The constructor recieves the `steps` from the pipeline to [allow use of pipeline step within the class code]().

[`readLines(String path)`](./FileHelper.html#readLines)

> reads the records of a file at location `path` and returns an `ArrayList` of the individual records.

## <a id="GitHelper"></a> GitHelper
The [`GitHelper`](./GitHelper.html) class serves as a wrapper around the Git SCM plugin and provides the methods

[`GitHelper(steps)`](./GitHelper.html#GitHelper)

> The constructor recieves the `steps` from the pipeline to [allow use of pipeline step within the class code]().

[`checkout(String gitUrl, String gitBranch, String gitCredentials, String tttFolder)`](./GitHelper.html#checkout)

> checks out the branch `gitBranch` in the Git(Hub) repository at `gitUrl`. It uses the `gitCredentials` to authenticate, and places the cloned Git repository into the folder `tttFolder` (within the Jenkins workspace).

[`checkoutPath(String gitUrl, String gitBranch, String path, String gitCredentials, String gitProject)`](./GitHelper.html#checkoutPath)

> performs a *sparse checkout*, and checks out path `path` in the branch `gitBranch` in the project `gitProject` in the Git(Hub) repository at `gitUrl`. It uses the `gitCredentials` to authenticate.

## <a id="IspwHelper"></a> IspwHelper
The [`IspwHelper`](./IspwHelper.html) class serves as a wrapper around the Compuware ISPW plugin and provides the methods

`IspwHelper(steps, pConfig)`

> The constructor recieves the `steps` from the pipeline to [allow use of pipeline step within the class code]() and a [`PipelineConfig`](./PipelineConfig.html) to make use of pipeline execution specific parameters.

[`downloadSources()`](./IspwHelper.html#downloadSources)

> downloads all sources (COBOL programs and copybooks) contained in [ISPW set](../pipelines/scenario/ISPW_scenario.html#The resulting set) triggering the pipeline

[`downloadCopyBooks(String workspace)`](./IspwHelper.html#downloadCopyBooks)

> - recieves the path to the `workspace` of the pipeline job
> - uses the `referencedCopyBooks` method to determine all copybooks used by the download COBOL programs
> - uses a [`JclSkeleton`](#JclSkeleton) object's `createIebcopyCopyBooksJcl` method to create an `IEBCOPY` job `JCL` that copies all required copybooks in the list from the ISPW libraries into a temporary PDS
> - submits this `JCL` using the [Topaz Utilities](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Compuware+Topaz+Utilities+Plugin) plugin
> - downloads the content of the temporary PDS, using the [ISPW PDS downloader](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Compuware+Source+Code+Download+for+Endevor,+PDS,+and+ISPW+Plugin)
> - uses the `JclSkeleton` method `jclSkeleton.createDeleteTempDsn` to create a `DELETE` job `JCL`
> - and submits that `JCL`

[`referencedCopyBooks(String workspace)`](./IspwHelper.html#referencedCopyBooks)

> - recieves the path to the `workspace` of the pipeline job
> - searches all `*.cbl` program sources in the folder containing all downloaded sources and builds a list of COBOL programs
> - for each program in the list it
    > - reads the source file
    > - scans the content for valid `COPY` statements (e.g. not comments)
    > - determines the referenced copybook 
    > - add each copybook to the list of copybooks
> - returns the resulting list of copybooks

[`regressAssignmentList(assignmentList, cesToken)`](./IspwHelper.html#regressAssignmentList)

> recieves a list of assignment IDs in `assignmentList`, the [CES Token]() in `cesToken` and calls method `regressAssignment` for each element of `assignmentList`

[`def regressAssignment(assignment, cesToken)`](./IspwHelper.html#regressAssignment)

> receives an Assignment ID in `assigment`, the [CES Token]() in `cesToken` and uses the ISPW REST API to regress the assignment

## <a id="JclSkeleton"></a> JclSkeleton
The [`JclSkeleton`](./JclSkeleton.html) class allows the pipelines to customize pieces of `JCL` in certain, predefined ways. This allows changing e.g. `job cards`, `STEPLIB` concatenations and others during runtime. The `JCL` skeletons are read from folder ['./config/skels'](../config_files/Jcl_skeletons.html) in the pipeline workspace.

[`JclSkeleton(steps, String workspace, String ispwApplication, String ispwPathNum)`](.JclSkeleton.html#JclSkeleton)

> The constructor recieves the `steps` from the pipeline to [allow use of pipeline step within the class code](), the path to the pipeline `workpace`, the name of the ISPW application in `ispwApplication` and the [number of the development path](../pipelines/scenario/TTT_scenario.html#The runner.jcl) in `pathNum`.

[`initialize()`](.JclSkeleton.html#initialize)

> is used for additional [initialization which cannot be executed in the custructor]() and 
> - reads the `JobCard.jcl` skeleton file
> - reads the `deleteDs.skel` skeleton file  
> - initializes the `IEBCOPY` `JCL` by using the `buildIebcopySkel` method

[`buildIebcopySkel()`](.JclSkeleton.html#buildIebcopySkel)

> initializes the `IEBCOPY` `JCL` by
> - reading the `iebcopy.skel` skeleton file (main `JCL`) 
> - reading the `iebcopyInDd.skel` skeleton file (input `DD` statements)
> - building the required `INDD=INx` cards
> - replacing the placeholders in the skeleton `JCL` by the conrete values
> - returning the resulting `JCL` code

[`createIebcopyCopyBooksJcl(String targetDsn, List copyMembers)`](.JclSkeleton.html#createIebcopyCopyBooksJcl)

> recieves the target DSN for the `IEBCOPY` job in `targetDsn` and the list of required copybooks in `copyMembers` and
> - places the `job card` from `initialize` in front of the `JCL` code
> - builds a `SELECT MEMBER=` card for each entry in `copyMembers`
> - replaces the placeholders in the skeleton `JCL` by the conrete values
> - returns the resulting `JCL`code

[`createDeleteTempDsn(String targetDsn)`](.JclSkeleton.html#createDeleteTempDsn)

> recieves the target DSN for the `DELETE` job in `targetDsn` and
> - places the `job card` from `initialize` in front of the `JCL` code
> - adds the `DELETE` skeleton code
> - replaces the placeholders in the skeleton `JCL` by the conrete values
> - returns the resulting `JCL`code

[`readSkelFile(String fileName)`](.JclSkeleton.html#readSkelFile)

> receives a `fileName` and 
> - reads the corresponding file from the skeletons folder in the pipeline workspace
> - returns the content of the file as list of records

## <a id="PipelineConfig"></a> PipelineConfig
The [`PipelineConfig`](./PipelineConfig.html) class stores and allows retrieval of any pipeline [configuration and runtime specific parameters](../pipelines/pipeline_parameters.html). 

[`PipelineConfig(steps, workspace, params, mailListLines)`](.PipelineConfig.html#PipelineConfig)

> The constructor recieves the `steps` from the pipeline to [allow use of pipeline step within the class code](), the path of the pipeline `workspace` the `Map` `params` containing the `key:value` parameter pairs from the [pipeline call](../pipelines/Mainframe_CI_Pipeline_from_Shared_Lib.html#Loading the script from a shared library), and a the list of records from the [`mailList.config` file](../tool_configuration/Config_Files.html#The email list) and initializes all parameters that can be initialized immediately.

[`initialize()`](.PipelineConfig#initialize)

> is used for additional [initialization which cannot be executed in the custructor]() and 
> - deletes any old content from the pipeline workspace
> - Uses the `checkoutPath`method of the [`GitHelper` class](#GitHelper) to download the path containing the configuration files from the GitHub repository containing the configuration. (In future configuration files will be move to [Managed Files](../tool_configuration/tool_configuration.html#Managed Files), thus avoiding to have to download configuration from GitHub and exposure of configuration on GitHub.)
> - execute the following internal methods to set the remaining configuration values

[`setServerConfig()`](.PipelineConfig#setServerConfig)

> - reads the pipeline configuration file `pipeline.config`, containing server URLs (e.g. Sonar, XL Release) etc.
> - extracts the values for the corresponding parameters
> - sets the parameters

[`setTttGitConfig()`](.PipelineConfig#setTttGitConfig)

> - reads the pipeline configuration file `tttgit.config`, containing information about the GitHub repository storing the Topaz for Total Test projects
> - extracts the values for the corresponding parameters
> - sets the parameters

[`setMailConfig()`](.PipelineConfig#setMailConfig)

> - loops though the list of `mailListLines` containing the `TSO user:email` pairs
> - turns the records into a `Map`
> - determines the email address for the owner of the ISPW set and sets the parameter `mailRecipient` accordingly

[`readConfigFile(String fileName)`](.PipelineConfig#readConfigFile)

> uses an instance of the [`FileHelper`](#FileHelper) class to read the configuration files
